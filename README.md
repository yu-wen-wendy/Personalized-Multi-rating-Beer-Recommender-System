# Personalized-Multi-Rating-Beer-Recommender-System
Developed a recommender system that can handle multiple ratings by using correlation factors and collaborative filtering algorithms for personalized beer recommendations.

Recommendation system has been developed with modern data mining techniques including preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and various distance metrics. (Mehrbakhsh, 2016)
Collaborative filtering is the most widely used algorithm for recommendation system.(Badrul Munir, et al., 2001) 
Latent factor algorithm is derived to overcome the weakness of native collaborative filtering algorithm in dealing with challenging issues such as scalability, noises in dataset, and data sparsity. (Koren, Yehuda, Robert Bell, and Chris Volinsky, 2009)
Clustering methods are also applicable for picking representative values for recommendation such as k-means and spectral clustering. Especially, there was a trial that used spectral clustering to improve vulnerability of collaborative filtering. (Zhang, Zhuo, and Sanjeev R. Kulkarni, 2014)
Graph representation also has contributed to recommendation system. Link analysis and prediction also has contributed to recommendation system, to solve data sparsity problem. (Chen, Hsinchun, Xin Li, and Zan Huan, 2005)
